# What about project? 🤔
This project is a ticket system via QR Codes, what means this? <br>

When OpenCV detects a QR code, the system registers it in a local (sqlite) database.<br>
If it's the first time detecting the QR Code, a message will be displayed sayinge<br>
saying “Entrando”. (Entering), if it is not the first time and the QR code<br>
was marked as “Entering” a message saying “Saliendo” (Exiting) will be displayed. <br><br>
Like it was a ticket system or something like that. 🤓
